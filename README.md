# SimpleMinds: AI-Powered Construction Hazard Detection Application

**SimpleMinds** is an AI-powered mobile application designed to enhance safety on construction sites by detecting potential hazards in real-time. Built using **Flutter**, the app leverages on-device computer vision models to identify risks, helping construction workers and managers prevent accidents and ensure a safer working environment.  

## Key Features

- **Real-time Hazard Detection:** Uses AI to detect unsafe conditions or objects on construction sites directly from the camera feed.  
- **On-device Processing:** Runs AI inference locally on the device for fast detection and offline capability.  
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive design tailored for construction workers and site supervisors.  
- **Safety Alerts:** Notifies users immediately when a hazard is detected to prevent potential accidents.
- **Snapdragon AI Core Acceleration:** Leverages **Snapdragon AI Core** for GPU/NPU acceleration, enabling high-speed, low-latency inference on supported devices.
- **Cross-platform:** Built with Flutter, supporting both Android and iOS devices.  

## How It Works

1. The user points the device camera at the construction site.  
2. The app processes the video feed using a trained AI model to detect hazards.  
3. Detected hazards are highlighted on-screen with real-time visual indicators.  
4. Alerts or notifications are triggered for unsafe conditions.  

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development  
- **TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile** for on-device AI inference
- **Qualcomm AI Hub** for optimized AI model deployment  
- **Snapdragon AI Core** for hardware-accelerated AI inference 
- **OpenCV & Image Processing Libraries** for pre-processing camera feeds
